# Musical (Y)ear

1) Pick one of the 12 keys of the scale each month and work on a chosen set of tasks to learn the piano.

2) Order of keys per month is from B -> Db downwards

3) Once a key is chosen, I will stick to it for the month

4) I will work on the "must do's" and if time permits the "nice to have"s

5) I will devote time to this, on average, at least 30mins per day

# Tasks

## Must Do
* work on a piece in the chosen key (and record it)
* scales (major, harmonic minor) (a third apart, contrary motion, eyes closed)
* scale chords
* triads and their inversions
* arpeggios
* chord progressions
* improvise over chord progressions
* develop and record a musical idea (motif or phrase) - use my ear to guide me

## Nice to get Done
* compose an entire piece (perhaps built up from musical ideas)
* other modes
* broken chords
* natural minor scale
