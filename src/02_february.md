## Key: B

## Possible pieces

- [Chopin Prelude B Major op 28 no 11 ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=if581k1tE9U)
- [Bach/Siloti Prelude B Minor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yu06WnXlPCY)

## Notes
Bach/Siloti is quite challenging for me due to large spread of notes over a 10th (I can span a 9th).
I'm considering transcribing it to fit my hand. See also this video for reference:
